# Hello-World
My first Hello World application with GitHub
My computer experience started with DEC Assembly and Fortran in 1973.  Fast-forward to 2016 when I retired from 3M having written the Global Helpdesk tool and the auto-provisioning tools tied to HR for creation thru end-of-life for all workforce accounts.  But through all that, I never learned very much about web development.
